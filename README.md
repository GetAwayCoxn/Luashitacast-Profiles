# Luashitacast-Profiles
These are my luashitacast profiles for FFXI Ashita v4

I will eventually clean the code/comments/etc and provide a better readme. This is very much in an alpha status however these profiles are able to have the gear sets edited and ran in current retail.

Be aware that I use two custom files that need to be in the common folder, gcinclude and gcdisplay. The latter is a just a slighty modified version of Thornys included varhelper.lua, credit to him for that.

The biggest issue at the moment is that the profiles will not always load properly or even sometimes crash when you first log in or zone in due to some of the called resources not being available yet by the client. If you get any errors/crashes or anything weird on log in or zone in just reload with /lac load or /addon load luashitacast if it crashed to resolve until I figure out a better work around for this. Hence the very much in an alpha status statement.
