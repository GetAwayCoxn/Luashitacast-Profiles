# Luashitacast-Profiles
These are my luashitacast profiles for FFXI Ashita v4

I will eventually clean the code/comments/etc and provide a better readme. This is very much in an alpha status however these profiles are able to have the gear sets edited and ran in current retail.

Be aware that I use two custom files that need to be in the common folder, gcinclude and gcdisplay. The latter is a just a slighty modified version of Thornys included varhelper.lua, credit to him for that.
